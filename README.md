## üóÑÔ∏è Database Design
The database is structured using **PostgreSQL** to manage key entities and their relationships.

| Entity      | Key Fields                       | Relationships           |
|-------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Users**   | `user_id` (PK), `email`, `password_hash`, `name`, `phone` | Owns multiple properties; creates bookings/review (1:N). |
| **Properties** | `property_id` (PK), `owner_id` (FK), `title`, `description`, `price_per_night` | Belongs to one user; has multiple bookings/reviews (1:N). |
| **Bookings** | `booking_id` (PK), `user_id` (FK), `property_id` (FK), `check_in_date`, `check_out_date` | Belongs to one user and one property (N:1). |
| **Reviews** | `review_id` (PK),`user_id` (FK), `property_id` (FK), `rating`, `comment` | Belongs to one user and one property (N:1). |
| **Payments** | `payment_id` (PK), `booking_id` (FK), `amount`, `payment_date`, `status` | Belongs to one booking (N:1). |

## üöÄ Feature Breakdown
- **User Management**

Securely handles user registration, authentication, and profile updates. This feature ensures a personalized and safe platform experience.

- **Property Management**

Enables hosts to create, update and delete listings, forming the core of the platform. It allows users to browse and select accommodations easily.

- **Booking System**

Streamlines property reservations with check-in/check-out management. It connects users and hosts for efficient booking workflows.

- **Payment Processing**

Integrates secure payment gateways for booking transactions. Ensures trust and reliability in financial operations.

- **Review System**

Allows users to post ratings and comments for properties. Enhances transparency and helps users make informed decisions.

- **Data Optimization**

Leverages indexing and Redis caching to improve data retrieval speed. Ensures a fast, responsive user experience.

## üîí API Security
Securing the backend APIs is critical for protecting user data and ensuring platform integrity. Key measures include:
- **Authentication**
Uses **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** to verify user identity, preventing unauthorized access to protected endpoints like user profiles.

- **Authorization**
Implements **role-based access control** (e.g., hosts vs. guests) to restrict actions like property updates.
Ensures users only perform permitted actions.

- **Rate Limiting**
Limits API request frequency to prevent abuse and DDoS attacks. Maintains platform stability and resource availability.

- **Data Encryption**
Employs **HTTPS** and encrypted database storage for sensitive data like payment details. Builds user trust and complies with data protection standards.

<details>
<summary>üîç Additional Security Details</summary>

- **Input Validation**: Prevents SQL injection and XSS attacks by sanitizing user inputs.
- **Secure Password Hashing**: Uses bcrypt to securely hash passwords, protecting user credentials.
- **Regular Security Audits**: Conducts periodic audits to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.

## ‚öôÔ∏è  CI/CD Pipeline
**CI/CD pipelines** automate testing, building, and deploying code changes, ensuring reliable and efficient development cycles.
They reduce errors, maintain code quality, and enable seamless deployment of the backend.

- **Tools Used**:
  - **GitHub Actions**: Automates testing and deployment workflows.
  - **Docker**: Ensures consistent environments across development, testing, and production.

- **Why It Matters**:
